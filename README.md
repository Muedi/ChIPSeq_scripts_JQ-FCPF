These scripts where used to produce the analysis and Plots regarduing the ChIPseq analysis of the above mentuioned paper.
Each script contains a short iscription in its header.

For some scripts to work, there need to be an additional folder named "bams" containing the aligned reads in BAM-format, as well as BigWigs (.bw) generated from these with bedtools.
